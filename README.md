# Passport-OpenID

[Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) strategy for authenticating
with [OpenID](http://openid.net/).

## Installation

    $ npm install passport-openid

## Usage

#### Configure Strategy

The OpenID authentication strategy authenticates users using an OpenID
identifier.  The strategy requires a `validate` callback, which accepts this
identifier and calls `done` providing a user.  Additionally, options can be
supplied to specify a return URL and realm.

    passport.use(new OpenIDStrategy({
        returnURL: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/openid/return',
        realm: 'http://localhost:3000/'
      },
      function(identifier, done) {
        User.findByOpenID({ openId: identifier }, function (err, user) {
          return done(err, user);
        });
      }
    ));

#### Authenticate Requests

Use `passport.authenticate()`, specifying the `'openid'` strategy, to
authenticate requests.

For example, as route middleware in an [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
application:

    app.post('/auth/openid',
      passport.authenticate('openid'),
      function(req, res){
        // The request will be redirected to the user's OpenID provider for
        // authentication, so this function will not be called.
      });

    app.get('/auth/openid/return', 
      passport.authenticate('openid', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
      function(req, res) {
        // Successful authentication, redirect home.
        res.redirect('/');
      });
